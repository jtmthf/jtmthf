As of Next.js 14,
[server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations)
are stable and are an excellent pattern for implementing forms in web
applications. As documented on the Next.js website, server actions are
asynchronous functions executed on the server and can be triggered by a form
submission. Although the documentation provides ample information on using
server actions, there's limited guidance on effectively using them with forms,
including handling accessibility and validation. Before the introduction of
server actions, I often would lean on solutions such as
[react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com) to address these requirements.
Through experimentation, I discovered a solution that not only leverages the
capabilities of server actions but also provides a lightweight approach to form
handling. In this article, I'll share my insights on integrating server actions
seamlessly with forms in Next.js applications.

Upon embarking on my quest for an off-the-shelf form experience, I first turned
to [shadcn ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). Unlike traditional component libraries,
shadcn ui is not installed as a dependency but instead adds components directly
to your project source using its CLI. By not making itself a dependency, shadcn
ui affords complete flexibility to customize and tweak to your needs. Leveraging
frameworks like [radix ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) and
[tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com) internally, shadcn ui provides a
versatile selection of components for building user interfaces.

Upon examining the shadcn ui [Form](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form)
component, I discovered that it relies on react-hook-form for its core
functionality and [zod](https://zod.dev) for validation. While react-hook-form
is a popular choice for client-side form handling, it does not align well with
server actions due to its client-side submission approach. Additionally, while
zod offers robust validation capabilities, it introduces
[significant overhead](https://bundlephobia.com/package/zod@3.22.4) to the
client bundle, which may impact performance.

After exploring shadcn ui's dependencies, I turned to radix ui for a potential
solution and discovered its
[Form](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/form) component.
While still in preview, the Form component offers a promising feature set that
makes it more than workable in its current state. Key features include:

- Built on top of the native browser constraint validation API.
- Supports built-in validation.
- Supports custom validation.
- Full customization of validation messages.
- Accessible validation messages.
- Supports client-side and server-side scenarios.
- Focus is fully managed.

Despite its preview status and the possibility of API changes in the future, I
found the radix ui Form component to be a viable option for integrating server
actions with forms in Next.js applications. With the radix Form component
identified as a promising solution that seamlessly integrates with server
actions, let's delve into the implementation details. To get started, we need to
install the radix form component:

```sh
npm install @radix-ui/react-form
```

In line with shadcn ui conventions, we'll organize our form components inside
the `components/ui` directory. To begin, create the file
`src/components/ui/form.tsx`. The first form components we'll handle are those
that will be re-exported without applying any customization. Those are
`FormControl` and `FormValidityState`.

```tsx
'use client';

import * as Form from '@radix-ui/react-form';

const FormControl = Form.Control;
const FormValidityState = Form.ValidityState;

export { FormControl, FormValidityState };
```

`FormControl` wraps the input element. Examples could be `<input>`, `<select>`,
or `<textarea>`. While `FormValidityState` takes a render prop of the field
validity status. This is for advanced use cases and won't be needed in this
example.

The next component we'll handle is `FormMessage` which is shown for validation
errors. We don't need to customize its functionality but we will apply some
styling using [twc](https://react-twc.vercel.app).

```tsx
import * as Form from '@radix-ui/react-form';
import { twx } from '@/lib/utils';

const FormMessage = twx(Form.Message)`text-sm font-medium text-destructive`;
FormMessage.displayName = 'FormMessage';
```

`twx` is a utility function that combines [twc](https://react-twc.vercel.app)
with [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge). twc is handy
library for projects using tailwind as it will forward refs, merge classnames,
and composes with its children when `asChild` is set. It's essentially a
replacement for the below boilerplate had we not used twc.

```tsx
function FormMessage({
  className,
  asChild = false,
  ...props
}: React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLSpanElement> & { asChild?: boolean }) {
  const Comp = asChild ? Slot : 'span';

  return (
    <Comp
      data-slot="form-message"
      className={clsx('text-destructive text-sm font-medium', className)}
      {...props}
    />
  );
}
```

clsx by itself doesn't handle conflicts between tailwind styles so we create a
custom version of twc using tailwind merge and name that utility `twx`.

```tsx
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';
import { createTwc } from 'react-twc';

export const twx = createTwc({ compose: cn });
```

As a tip, add the below config to your vscode settings as it will allow for
hover previews of the css utilities when using the
[tailwind vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss).

```json
{
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    "twx\\.[^`]+`([^`]*)`",
    "twx\\(.*?\\).*?`([^`]*)",
    ["twx\\.[^`]+\\(([^)]*)\\)", "(?:'|\"|`)([^']*)(?:'|\"|`)"],
    ["twx\\(.*?\\).*?\\(([^)]*)\\)", "(?:'|\"|`)([^']*)(?:'|\"|`)"]
  ]
}
```

The first custom component we'll create is the `FormRoot`. Internally it'll
render a `<form>` element and will accept an `action` prop that we will pass our
server action to. In order to provide the server validation state to children,
we'll create `FormContextValue` that will contain an `errors` record property of
all error messages returned by the server. With the React hook
[`useFormState`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormState), we
are able to get the return value of a server action. That returned value is then
provided through context to be used by our remaining components.

```tsx
type FormContextValue = { errors: Record<string, string[] | undefined> };

const FormContext = React.createContext<FormContextValue>({ errors: {} });

type FormRootProps = Omit<
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Form.Root>,
  'action'
> & {
  action: (
    state: FormContextValue,
    formData: FormData,
  ) => Promise<FormContextValue>;
};

function FormRoot({ action, ...props }: FormRootProps) {
  const [state, formAction] = useFormState(action, { errors: {} });

  return (
    <FormContext.Provider value={state}>
      <Form.Root data-slot="form-root" {...props} action={formAction} />
    </FormContext.Provider>
  );
}
FormRoot.displayName = 'FormRoot';
```

For the `FormField` component, we're going to get the form context value and if
there were any errors returned by the server for that field, we'll render
`FormMessage`s for each error.

```tsx
function FormField({
  className,
  children,
  ...props
}: React.ComponentProps<typeof Form.Field>) {
  const state = React.useContext(FormContext);

  return (
    <Form.Field
      {...props}
      data-slot="form-field"
      className={cn('space-y-2', className)}
      serverInvalid={Boolean(state.errors[props.name])}
    >
      {children}
      {state.errors[props.name]?.map((error) => (
        <FormMessage key={error}>{error}</FormMessage>
      ))}
    </Form.Field>
  );
}
FormField.displayName = 'FormField';
```

Next we're going to create the `FormLabel`. We're going use shadcn ui's own
`Label` component so make sure to install that first with
`npx shadcn-ui@latest add label`. In this implementation, we utilize radix ui's
behavior of setting the `data-invalid` attribute on field elements when they are
invalid. This allows us to dynamically apply the `text-destructive` Tailwind
utility to the `Label` component when the field is invalid, indicating an issue
to the user.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as Form from '@radix-ui/react-form';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';
import { Label } from '@/components/ui/label';

function FormLabel({
  className,
  ...props
}: React.ComponentProps<typeof Label>) {
  return (
    <Form.Label asChild>
      <Label
        {...props}
        data-slot="form-label"
        className={cn('data-invalid:text-destructive', className)}
      />
    </Form.Label>
  );
}
FormLabel.displayName = 'FormLabel';
```

To finalize our form components, let's define the `FormSubmit` button. Similar
to previous components, we'll utilize a shadcn ui `Button` component, which can
be installed with `npx shadcn-ui@latest add button`. As an enhancement, we'll
include a loading spinner to indicate form submission. This can be achieved
using the
[`useFormStatus`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus)
hook provided by react-dom, which tracks the status of form submissions. This
hook must be used in a component that's a child to a `<form>` element and
returns the status of a form including if submission is pending.

```tsx
import { Loader2 } from 'lucide-react';
import * as React from 'react';
import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom';
import * as Form from '@radix-ui/react-form';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

function FormSubmit({
  className,
  children,
  ...props
}: React.ComponentProps<typeof Button>) {
  const status = useFormStatus();

  return (
    <Form.Submit asChild>
      <Button
        {...props}
        data-slot="form-submit"
        className={cn('mt-4', className)}
      >
        {status.pending && <Loader2 className="mr-2 size-4 animate-spin" />}
        {children}
      </Button>
    </Form.Submit>
  );
}
FormSubmit.displayName = 'FormSubmit';
```

With that, we're ready to start implementing our form. For this example, let's
implement a simple login form that takes an email and a password.

![login form](/assets/blog/nextjs-forms/login.png)

We're going to start with the server action implementation as we're going to use
it with our form. zod will be used for validation but as it's being used within
a server action it won't be included in the client bundle. If the correct email
and password are provided, the user will be redirected to a new page. Otherwise
we will return an object with the error messages to show to user keyed by the
field name. For the purpose of this demonstration we'll use a hardcoded email
and password.

```tsx
'use server';

import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';
import { z } from 'zod';

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().trim().email(),
  password: z.string().trim().min(1),
});

export type Result = {
  errors: {
    email?: string[];
    password?: string[];
  };
};

export async function login(
  _previousState: Result,
  data: FormData,
): Promise<Result> {
  // one second delay to demonstrate the loading spinner
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

  const parseResult = schema.safeParse(Object.fromEntries(data.entries()));

  // if parse validation failed, return flattened errors
  if (!parseResult.success) {
    return { errors: parseResult.error.flatten().fieldErrors };
  }

  const { email, password } = parseResult.data;

  // simple example with hardcoded allowed email and password. All others will
  // be invalid
  if (email !== 'admin@example.com') {
    return { errors: { email: ['Invalid email'] } };
  }

  if (password !== 'admin') {
    return { errors: { password: ['Invalid password'] } };
  }

  // If correct email and password are provided, redirect to a new page
  redirect('/dashboard');
}
```

As our server action is wrapped client side with `useFormState`, the first
argument to the action is the previous state from the prior invocation. As we
won't be needing that, we'll prefix it with an underscore. Then as the 2nd
argument, we receive the `FormData` which is a container of all input values
submitted with the form. Each value can be looked up by the associated `name`
property of the input. As an easier solution, we'll convert it to a plain object
using
[`Object.fromEntries`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web///Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries).

Validation errors will be handled by zod by first flattening the result and then
returning the error messages keyed by the field name. These will map to the
input names to show error messages if needed. In order to customize the error
message, zod validators optionally take a message as their parameter that will
be substituted.

```ts
z.string().trim().email('You must provide a valid email');
```

For implementing the form, we'll use all the form elements we've created along
with the server action previously defined. Note that this component can be
rendered as a server component as all the client-side interactivity is isolated
to the form internals. A good use case for this being a server component is
dynamic forms where the fields to show to the user is not known until runtime.

```tsx
import {
  FormControl,
  FormField,
  FormLabel,
  FormMessage,
  FormRoot,
  FormSubmit,
} from '@/components/ui/form';
import { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';
import { login } from './login-action';

export function LoginForm() {
  return (
    <FormRoot action={login}>
      <FormField name="email">
        <FormLabel>Email</FormLabel>
        <FormControl asChild>
          <Input type="email" required />
        </FormControl>
        <FormMessage match="valueMissing">Please enter your email.</FormMessage>
        <FormMessage match="typeMismatch">
          Please provide a valid email.
        </FormMessage>
      </FormField>
      <FormField name="password">
        <FormLabel>Password</FormLabel>
        <FormControl asChild>
          <Input type="password" required />
        </FormControl>
        <FormMessage match="valueMissing">
          Please enter your password.
        </FormMessage>
      </FormField>
      <FormSubmit>Log in</FormSubmit>
    </FormRoot>
  );
}
```

With that taken care of, it's time to test. If we enter an invalid password, we
can then see that a message is displayed in the UI that the password is invalid.
A similar message would appear if the email is incorrect. However if both the
email and password are correct, we redirect the user to the `/dashboard` page.

![login form with invalid password](/assets/blog/nextjs-forms/login-invalid.png)

In conclusion, we've built a set of reusable form elements that are compatible
with server actions and server components. The form is accessible to screen
readers and supports both client and server side validation. As no 3rd party
styling is relied upon, all elements can be customized as needed to fit your app
brand. Due to the flexibility afforded by the solution, this is how I intend to
implement forms in my apps going forward.

The code for this implementation is available on
[Github](https://github.com/jtmthf/next-form) and if you'd like to play around
with a demo, that can be found [here](https://next-form-three.vercel.app).
